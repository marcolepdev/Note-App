# Note-App
Simple Note App with Modal Window

### Table of Contents
## About  

This is a simple note application which allows the user the create short notes and to remove them, when the note is no longer necessary. When the note is deleted, it is not possible to retrieve it back. The user has to create a new one.

## How it works
The user has to type some text in the textarea and to hit the "add note" button and the note will be dynamically showed below.
There three main buttons:  
- to create the note  
- to delete all notes  
- to reset or clear the text area  

When the note is created, two more buttons will appear.  
- to remove or delete the note permanently  
- to expand the note in a new window (modal window)

If the inner note text is long enough to not be showed entirely inside the main container, the user can see the text in its entirety by pressing the "enlarge" icon.  
By clicking the "enlarge icon" the text will be showed entirely in a new window. In order to close this window and get back to the notes' list, the user has to simply press the "close button".
